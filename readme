Purpose

easytest is a lightweight test framework, which can distribute test scripts to
multiple linux servers and run them in parallel. Currently, below features are
supported:

1) multiple-language 
   Test scripts can be written in vary of languages (shell, python, perl, ...)
   only if relevant run-time/interpreter is available on target machine;
   
2) test group
   Tests can be grouped together and run intentionally, e.g. all data
   compression realted tests are put into group-compressin, all network related
   tests are put into group-network, etc. 

3) statistic
   When tests are finished, the information about how many tests are
   passed/failed/skipped is collected. 


Design

1) testMgr
The wrapper and single entry point of easytest framework, which will start and
serialize the whole test procedure

2) testsetMgr 
The util class for collecting tests to be run per user input.

3) authMgr
Read authenticat info of both test server and easytest daemon from config file.

4) envMgr
The util class for env setup, which copies easytest agent and test scripts to
test machine(s).

5) resultMgr
The util classes for updating test results timely per notice from easytest
agents, and notify termMgr to update terminal output

6) termMgr
The util class for managing and updating ternial output timely.

7) logger
the utill module to provide logging interface for each module.

For more details, check UML diagrams under doc/ folder or just read code.


Configuration & Usage:

1) Python3 & python paramiko & openssh should be installed to run easytest
2) Download easytest code to your linux 
3) Go to easytest directory, modify config.ini per your actual env

   $ cd easytest
   $ cat config.ini
   [server]
   username=stephenw         # account of test server
   password=l0ve2o19         # password of test server

   [daemon]
   port=17258                # port of easytest daemon 
   username=easytestagent    # account of easytest daemon 
   password=syncme           # password of easytest daemon

4) Run tests with easytest
   under easy test 
   $./run.py --group C13 --server 127.0.0.1
